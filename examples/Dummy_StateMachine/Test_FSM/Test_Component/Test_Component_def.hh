 * NAME: Test Component
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *
 * The purpose of the Optical Disk Cabinet Management System is to make optical
 * disks available for reading and writing. To do this the system must track
 * where a disk currently resides (either inside or outside the cabinet), as
 * well as causes the disk to be moved to a drive. The system is also
 * responsible for putting disks back in a known location after use.
 * 
 * The system is not responsible for actually reading and writing the disks.
 * 
 * Prominent Objects: Disk, Slot, Robot, EE Port

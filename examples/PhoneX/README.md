This `main.cc` contains example code for the `PhoneX` model (available [here](https://github.com/IncQueryLabs/EMDW-Tests/tree/master/system-test))
In this example a `Call` object is created and multiple events 
are sent to it to show the behavior of its statemachine.

After generating cpp code from the `PhoneX` model overwrite
the generated `main.cc` with the supplied `main.cc`.
